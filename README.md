## News-Live

> I always wanted to build a news website as a pet project. I took this challenge and build this website in a different level. After doing a lot of research, I found [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) as a good api source to play around with and started building this project. The good thing about this api is that it doesn't need any apikey but it takes a little time to return data.
